<p>"My dear," said Mrs. Durnford to
her husband on his return from a long
walk, "I this morning received a letter
from poor Susan Boscawen, full of the
most lively expressions of her gratitude,
for the kind assistance which you gave
to her on the death of her father. She
has established herself at the Bazaar,
in Soho-square, which I understand is
a most respectable institution, founded
by a gentleman of considerable opulence
residing in the place, and by this means,
she is enabled to support her aged mother
and her two helpless brothers. The
one you know is a cripple, and the
other was born blind. If you have
no objection, I should like to take
the children to town some morning,
when it would be convenient to you to
accompany us, and shew them the interior
of our English Bazaar."</p>

<p>"Name your day and I will attend
you," replied Mr. Durnford. "The
sight will be both novel and pleasing to
the children, and I shall feel myself particularly
delighted in beholding the amiable
Susan, placed in a situation of
safety and emolument."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>"Pray, papa," said Theodore, a fine
boy about ten years of age, "what is
the meaning of the word Bazaar?"</p>

<p>"My dear boy," replied Mr. Durnford,
"the term Bazaar is given by the
Turks and Persians to a kind of Market
or Exchange, some of which are extremely
magnificent; that of Ispahan, in
Persia, surpasses all the other European
exchanges, and yet that of Taurus exceeds
it in size. There is the old and the
new Bazaar at Constantinople, the former
is chiefly for arms, and the latter for different
articles belonging to goldsmiths,
jewellers, furriers, and various other manufactures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
Our Bazaar in Soho-square,
was founded by Mr. Trotter, on premises
originally occupied by the store-keeper
general, consisting of several rooms
which are conveniently fitted up with
handsome mahogany counters, extending
not only round the sides, but in the
lower and upper apartments, forming a
parallelogram in the middle. These
counters, having at proper distances
flaps or falling doors, are in contiguity
with each other, but are respectively
distinguished by a small groove at a distance
of every four feet of counter, the
pannels of which are numbered with
conspicuous figures, and these are let
upon moderate terms to females who
can bring forward sufficient testimonies
of their moral respectability."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>"It appears to me to be a most excellent
establishment," said Mrs. Durnford,
"as it enables many a worthy
female to dispose of the produce of her
labours, without incurring the risk of
taking a shop which might prove unsuccessful,
and thus she would not only be
drained of every sixpence she possessed,
but she might be reduced to actual beggary
from the failure of her first attempt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>"True, my dear," replied Mr. Durnford,
"such is too frequently the case.
But in this institution no such danger
can arise. The person who from strong
recommendation obtains a counter in
our Bazaar, pays daily, three-pence for
every foot in length, and is not required
to hold her situation more than from day
to day. I have been told, that at present,
there are upwards of a hundred
females who are employed in these
rooms, and a more pleasing and novel
effect can hardly be imagined, than is
here produced by the sight of these elegant
little shops, filled with every species
of light goods, works of art, and female
ingenuity in general."</p>

<p>"Then you have seen the Bazaar,
papa?" said Maria, the eldest daughter
of Mr. Durnford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, my love," replied her father,
"I went over it about five weeks ago
with Lady Bellenden, who has placed
two very amiable young women there,
both of whom are the orphan daughters
of a country curate, one of them has a
counter for all sorts of painted ornaments,
the other for fine needle work.
But you shall see the Bazaar yourself,
Maria, and if your mother is disengaged,
I think we will set out to-morrow
morning, immediately after breakfast.
We shall then have plenty of time to
examine the contents of the Bazaar, and
return in time to receive our guests for
dinner."</p>

<p>To the inexpressible delight of all the
children, Mrs. Durnford immediately
assented to the proposal of her husband,
and it was agreed, that as the
young people had behaved themselves
lately much to the satisfaction of their
parents, they should all of them enjoy
the pleasure of a "visit to the Bazaar,"
except the baby in arms, and the
youngest boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Early the next morning Mr. and Mrs.
Durnford, with Maria and Emily, who
were twins, and just turned of twelve
years of age, and Caroline, a sweet
little girl about seven, accompanied by
Theodore, proceeded with light hearts
and buoyant spirits to town, which was
only two miles from the residence of their
father, a gentleman of large independent
fortune. They had frequently visited
the metropolis, had been once to a play,
and had seen several other places worthy
of their inspection, but they all felt their
curiosity strongly excited to view the
Bazaar, as well as to behold once more
Susan Boscawen, who was a daughter
of a deceased tradesman, long a resident
in this village, and for whom they all
entertained a sincere regard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>On arriving at the place of their destination,
the young people were surprized
to see the square filled with elegant equipages,
some of them belonging to our
first nobility. "I believe, my dears,"
said Mr. Durnford, "that this is the
first time any of you have seen Soho-square."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, it is," cried Theodore,
"pray whose statue is that which I see
placed in the centre of that large area,
and what are those figures at the feet of
the statue."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>"It is, as you may observe, a pedestrian
statue of King Charles the Second,"
replied Mr. Durnford, "and
those wretched mutilated figures are emblematical
of the rivers, Thames, Trent,
Severn, and the Humber. The Square
was formerly called King-square, and I
believe some efforts have been made to
have that name revived. It has been
greatly altered since the original disposition
of the ground: then a fountain
of four streams fell into a basin in the
centre; where now stands the worn out
statue of King Charles. It was once
also called Monmouth-square, the Duke
of Monmouth then residing in the second
house; and tradition says, that on
the death of the Duke, his admirers
changed it to Soho, being the word of
the day at the battle of Sedgemoor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
The name of the unfortunate Duke is,
however, still preserved in that of Monmouth-street,
long celebrated for old
shops, old clothes, and shop cellars.
That house, my dears, is celebrated as
being the residence of the venerable and
worthy Sir Joseph Banks, whose whole
life has been devoted to science, and the
diffusion of every branch of useful knowledge."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>They now walked towards the Bazaar,
and in a few minutes entered the first
room, which is sixty-two feet long, and
thirty-six broad. The walls were hung
with red cloth, and at the ends were
large mirrors which reflected the surrounding
objects.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear mamma!" exclaimed Emily,
"let us stop a moment to look at these
beautiful ornaments, what a pretty gold
cross and pearl chain; I should like to
buy it for baby, only that it would come
to more than all my pocket money."</p>

<p>"I think, papa," said Maria, "that I
have read that pearls come chiefly from
Ceylon, and are taken from a particular
species of oyster."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>"You are right, my love," replied
Mr. Durnford, "there are too seasons
for pearl fishing. The first is in March
and April, and the last in August and
September, and the more rain there
falls in the year, the more plentiful are
the fisheries. The method of procuring
the pearls is rather singular. The diver
binds a stone six inches thick, and a foot
long under his body; which serves him
as ballast, prevents his being driven away
by the motion of the water, and enables
him to walk steadily under the waves.
They also tie a very heavy stone to one
foot, by which they are speedily sent to
the bottom of the sea; and as the oysters
are firmly fastened to the rocks, they
arm their hands with leather mittens, to
prevent their being bruised in pulling
the oysters violently off. Each diver
carries down with him a large net, tied
to his neck by a long cord, the other
end of which is fastened to the side of
his bark. The net is to hold the oysters,
and the cord to pull up the diver when
his bag is full. Thus equipped, he sometimes
flings himself sixty feet under
water, and when he arrives at the bottom,
he runs from side to side, tearing up
all the oysters he can meet with, and puts
them into his net as expeditiously as possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, papa! how frightened I should
be of the enormous great fishes," said
Caroline.</p>

<p>"They are certainly to be dreaded,
my love, but the diver no sooner perceives
one of them approaching, than he
pulls his cord, and the signal is attended
to immediately by those above. Look,
Emily, at this diamond, can you tell me
from whence they come?"</p>

<p>"I believe from the East Indies, papa,

<p>"Yes, my dear. This object of human
vanity was formerly called Adamant,
being the hardest body in nature. In
the East Indies, there are also two rivers,
in the sands of which are diamonds.
The miners frequently dig through
rocks, till they come to a sort of mineral
earth, in which the diamonds are enclosed,
and to prevent their concealing
any of them they are obliged to go naked.
The largest diamond ever known to
have been found, was that in the possession
of the Great Mogul, which weighed
two hundred and seventy-nine carats,
each carat being four grains."</p>

<p>counter. Maria called the attention of
Emily to a short fat coarse looking woman,
who was enquiring the price of some
muslin which the owner was shewing
her. "Five shillings a yard!" said she, in
a shrill voice, at the same time enlarging
her eyes and stretching out her hand,
"Why, I can buy as good as this at any
shop for three. Surely you must take
me for a ninny, to ask so much money
for your muslin." So saying, away she
walked highly offended, although the article
which she had rejected was offered
to her at its fair price.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durnford desired to look at some
Cambric, and while the man was searching
for it, she asked Caroline if she remembered
from what country the finest
was imported. The little girl hesitated,
and her mamma requested Maria to give
her the necessary information. "Cambric
is made in several parts of France and
Flanders," said Miss Durnford. "That
from Cambray is, however, esteemed
the best. We imitate it in Scotland,
but have not brought it to the perfection
of the foreign Cambric."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>"Very well! Maria," said her father,
"I am pleased to find that you remember
so well what you are told, and now Emily,
can you inform me what that fine cloth is
made of, which your mother has just
bought for your brother's shirts?" "It
is made of flax, papa, which in Latin is
<i>linum</i>, from whence the word linen and
<i>linon</i> is derived."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>"You are a good girl," said Mr. Durnford,
"and I mean to reward each of you
according to the knowledge which you
display during our visit to the Bazaar.
Flax grows in many parts of England,
and still more in Scotland and Ireland.
When fit to gather, it is taken by the flax
dressers, who pass it through water, strip
the slender stalks of the rind; and then
it becomes fit to split, and again undergoes
a process to prepare it for the
wheel. It is then spun into thread, more
or less fine according to the purpose it is
intended for. The very finest is as minute
as the smallest hair, and is used by
the lace makers. That is, of course, a
very fine sort of which the Cambric is
made. It is a singular thing that the
Romans, who in consequence of their extensive
conquests, became the most luxurious
people on earth, never discovered
the art of making linen from flax, or
hemp, which is a coarser plant of the
same kind. Their cloathing, though extremely
magnificent, being embroidered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
with purple, and often with gold, was
woven only of wool, and Voltaire, a celebrated
French writer, makes Tullia, the
beautiful and accomplished daughter of
Cicero, the greatest orator the world
ever saw, admire the superior elegance
of the toilet of an English lady. They
had neither stockings nor linen, for which
we should think the finery of their sandals
attached with gold cords, or their embroidered
vests fastened with diamond
lockets, made but a poor compensation."</p>

<p>"Oh! what a beautiful shawl, papa,"
cried Caroline, "I wish my sisters had
each one."</p>

<p>"That is very expensive, my sweet
girl," said her father, "it is made of the
fine wool of the Angora goat, a native of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>

manufactured in India. We vainly attempt

<p>as I perceive that your mamma has concluded
her purchases."</p>

<p>They now advanced towards the counter,
before which some children were
standing. A fine little boy, the picture
of health and happiness, was delighting
himself with a cart, while his elder brother,
with a less satisfied look, was listening
to the advice of his sister. "I want
that drum, and I will have it, Sophy, you
know I may buy what I like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, my dear Charles," replied his
sister, mildly, "but pray do not buy the
drum, as it will increase poor mamma's
bad headache."</p>

<p>"Don't have it, Charles," cried a
pretty rosy cheeked little girl, "don't
have it, if Sophy says not. You know
I mean to lay out my money just as she
pleases."</p>

<p>"So you may," said Charles, grumblingly,
"but I shall lay out mine as I
please, and the drum I will have."</p>

<p>The drum was accordingly handed
over to the young gentleman, and when
his sisters had bought their toys, they
gave them to a female attendant, and
moved onward.</p>

<p>"What a disagreeable rude boy that
was," remarked Caroline, "how unlike
his sisters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>"Quite so, my dear," said Mrs. Durnford,
"I am afraid he is badly managed
at home, and that, joined to a bad disposition,
will make him a very unamiable
character as he grows up. He should
have listened to the gentle advice of his
eldest sister, who from her dutiful attention
to the health and tranquillity of her
mother, gave evident proofs of a kind
and feeling heart."</p>

<p>Theodore and his sisters now selected a
variety of toys as well for themselves as for
their little brother, William. A composition
doll was bought for the baby, and a
very pretty white dog with a gilt collar
round its neck. The young ladies had
each a curious puzzle, and Caroline took
a fancy to an ass with its panniers loaded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
with vegetables. This toy her papa gave
her, as well as a nice painted box full of
sheep, trees, shepherd's hut, and a shepherd
and his dog, telling her at the same
time, that most of those kind of toys
came from Holland, and that they were
sold here much cheaper than we could
make them.</p>

not give his sister a morsel for all the

his father that he should like to have one.
"Your wish shall be gratified," replied
Mr. Durnford, "provided that you can
tell me the origin of its being so called."</p>

<p>"I think," said Theodore, "that the
god Pan fell in love with a nymph called
Syrinx, in the train of Diana, who, when
pursued by Pan fled for refuge to the
river Ladon, her father, who changed her
into a reed. Pan observing that the
reeds, when agitated by the wind, produced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
a pleasing sound, connected some
of them together, and formed them into a
rural pipe, and named it Syrinx."</p>

that Syrinx," said Mr. Durnford, "this
young gentleman has won it, by being
able to account for the cause of its bearing

<p>Mrs. Durnford instantly saw the cause of
her risibility, and though a smile, which
she could not repress, dimpled her face,
yet she cautioned her little girl not to give
way again to her demonstrations of merriment
in so public a manner, especially
as by so doing, she might inadvertently
wound the feelings of an individual.</p>

<p>The objects which had excited the
laughter of Caroline, were a short thick
made vulgar looking woman, and a tall
thin boy who stood as stiff as a poker,
with his hands fixed to his sides, while
his mother tried to force a hat on his
head, evidently too tight for him.</p>

<p>"It is too little for me, mother," cried
the boy, pouting out his lips which were
none of the thinnest, "and it won't do:
besides, I want one of them there new
fashioned caps, which all gentlemen's
sons wear now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>"And what have you to do with gentlemen's
sons," said his mother, trying to
get the hat a little further on his head,
"You know, Tommy, that your father is
only a tailor. He only serves gentlemen,
he is no gentleman himself. The hat is
a nice hat, and a good one for the money,
so you shall have it, Tommy. No new
fangled frippery for my money."</p>

<p>"But it won't come on my head, mother,"
exclaimed the boy, half crying for
vexation, because he was not to have a
cap like a gentleman's son.</p>

<p>"I tell you what, Tommy, if you are
not quiet, I'll trim your jacket for you,
better than ever your father has done, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
soon as I gets you home. Not do, why
it fits you delightfully, and you look quite
spruce and handsome in it. I won't have
it come any lower, spoiling the shape of
your ears. You want them to be like
Sam Wilson's ears, and they are just like
the ears of an ass, because he always puts
his hat behind them."</p>

<p>Poor Caroline now bit her lips, and
turned another way, lest she should again
offend her mamma by laughing.</p>

<p>"I think, papa," said Theodore, "that
hats are made from the fur of different
animals, are they not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear. The best is the beaver,
but many hats are now made of the fur
of the rabbit. Emily, do you recollect to
what bird we are indebted for those fine

<p>"She may not intend to make game
of him," replied Mr. Durnford, "but
young people cannot be too cautious
how they take liberties with those who
are so much their seniors. Perhaps,
Maria, you can inform me, how telescopes
were first invented. The optician has got
a very good sized one on his counter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>"The invention is owing rather to
chance than thought," said Miss Durnford,
modestly, "for if I remember right,
the children of a spectacle-maker at
Middleburgh, in Zealand, playing in
their father's shop, held two glasses between
their fingers at some distance from
each other, through which the weather-cock
on the steeple appeared much
larger than usual, and as if near to them,
but inverted. They spoke of it to their
father, who instantly thought of fixing
two glasses in brass circles, and placing
them so as to be drawn nearer or removed,
by this means he found he
could see objects more distinctly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>"That happened about the year
1590;" said Mr. Durnford, "but none of
the telescopes there made were above
eighteen inches long. The celebrated
Galileo, astronomer to the Grand Duke
of Tuscany, improved them; and the
invention has often been ascribed to
him. That was the refracting telescope,
but the reflecting telescope is the invention
of the great Sir Isaac Newton."</p>

<p>"I should like to have a microscope,
papa," said Theodore.</p>

<p>"My telescope may be converted into
a microscope, my dear," said his father,
"by removing the object-glass to a
greater distance from the eye-glass, as I
will show you when we go home. It is
generally supposed, that we owe the invention
of them to the Hollanders, and
that spectacles, so useful to the aged

flowers of every description, some
in wreaths for the ball-room, others
for the head, and some in bunches,
either for the bonnet or the bosom.</p>

<p>"What can be more beautiful than
this <i>bouquet</i> of Rosebuds, Myrtle, and
Geranium, how faithful a copy from nature!"
exclaimed Mrs. Durnford, "at a
little distance you would never suppose
them to be artificial. Had it been my
lot to have toiled for my daily support, I
think I should have preferred this business
to any other. It is a minor sort of painting,
as the different teints must all be arranged
by the hand of taste. I have seen
flowers that were scented with the perfume
belonging to them, but this made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
them come expensive, and they now
make them with the glowing colours of
nature, but without the richness of her
scent. I love to encourage humble merit,
and will therefore order a few of its productions
to be sent to Ivy Cottage."</p>

<p>said Caroline. "What is the name of
that large bird, papa? He will not hurt
us, will he? I think he looks angry."
"No, my darling! he will not hurt you,"
replied her father; "it is a blue Macaw,
a larger species of Parrot. Like all foreign
birds the plumage is more vivid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
and brilliant than ours, but we have the
advantage in song. The Humming-bird
is the smallest bird in the world, being
little more than three inches. The male
is green and gold on the upper part,
with a changeable copper gloss; the
under parts are grey. The throat and
fore part of the neck are a ruby colour,
in some lights as bright as fire. When
viewed sideways, the feathers appear
mixed with gold, and beneath of a dull
garnet colour. This beautiful little bird
is as admirable for its vast swiftness in
the air, and its manner of feeding, as for
the elegance and brilliancy of its colours.
Lightning is scarcely more transient than
its flight, nor the glare more vivid than
its colours. It never feeds but on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
wing, suspended over the flower from
which it extracts its nourishment. If
they find that any of their brethren have
been before them, they will, in a rage,
if possible, pluck it off and throw it on
the ground, and sometimes even tear it
to pieces.</p>

<p>"Beautiful as is the plumage of the
foreign birds, I give the preference to our
own. Who that ever heard the exquisite
note of the plain brown Nightingale
would regret its want of brilliant plumage?
What can equal the melodious
tones of the Robin, the mellow note of
the Linnet, the sweet call of the Blackbird,
and numerous others whose daily
song seems to arise in grateful thankfulness
to the throne of the Creator. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
have some birds, however, which may
almost vie with the beautiful plumage of
the foreign species. The Goldfinch,
King's Fisher, Bullfinch, and various
others, many of which you have seen at
your grandpapa's. The Pigeon and
Dove, the Peacock and Pheasant are
extremely beautiful. Indeed, nothing
in my opinion can equal the splendour
of the Peacock."</p>

<p>"From nature we will once more turn

morocco. The latter comes from a place
in Africa of that name, but we imitate it
ourselves, and not badly. The hide of

quantities of raw silk are imported here
from Italy and different parts, as well as
velvet, of which again we have an imitation.
You understand, my children, that

they tranquillized the poor girl's mind,
while Mr. Durnford strongly reprobated

long past the prime of life, but dressed

in a style of girlish fashion, with short
sleeves which shewed her shrivelled arms,
and still shorter petticoats, was viewing
herself with much complacency, as she
placed on her head, the grey hairs of
which were concealed by the flowing
tresses of an auburn wig, a large straw
hat, loaded with flowers and feathers, and
only fit for a young woman under thirty.</p>

<p>"Surely, mamma," cried Emily, "that
old lady can never intend to buy that
hat? It is too gay for one of her years."</p>

<p>"She certainly does," said Maria,
"and I dare say believes that it will make

<p>"She thinks wrong then, sister," exclaimed
Theodore. "For, unless she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
can hide the wrinkles in her face and
neck, and the loss of her teeth, and the
leanness of her body, she will only the
more expose her age, by dressing so

<p>The physician writes his prescription,

the order. Several of their medicines

camphire, and other dear articles introduced

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, my dear boy. But do you perfectly
comprehend what is a mineral?"</p>

<p>"A mineral, papa, is a semi-metal, as
they are called by the chemists, such as
antimony, zinc, bismuth, and others.
They are not inflammable, but are hard
and brittle, and may be reduced into
powder. Mercury or quicksilver has
been classed with semi-metals. Shall I
tell you how many metals there are,
papa?"</p>

<p>"If you please Theodore."</p>

<p>"There are six, papa. Gold, silver,
copper, tin, lead, and iron. The most
precious metals, such as gold and silver,
do not form the most splendid ones.
The pyrites, which are a mixture of iron
and sulphur, are more beautiful to the
eye."</p>

<p>"Very well remembered, Theodore.
But you forget to class the magnet as a
mineral."</p>

<p>"I do not perfectly understand the
nature of the magnet, papa."</p>

<p>"It is a species of Iron found in iron
mines," said Mr. Durnford, "which has
the singular property of attracting metal.
The ancients knew no means of finding
their way at sea, but by the stars; of
course when those celestial bodies were
not visible, the sailor was frequently at a
loss how to steer. A piece of steel is now
procured, made something like a needle,
but flat, about four inches long; this is
rubbed with the loadstone, and then
balanced exactly on two points or pivots,
so that it may turn round freely.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
This needle when fixed in a box, is called the
mariner's compass, and as it invariably
turns toward the North, the sailors can
now steer to any part of the world, which
they could not do without the help of
this piece of iron. The first knowledge
of this useful application of the magnet
is supposed to come from Marco Polo, a
Venetian, in the thirteenth century; but

<p>"I understand you, papa, and will try
to recollect. I know that it is to the
northern countries that we are indebted
for our furs. The ermine, whose beautiful
white fur and black tail lines the
coronets and mantles of our nobles, creeps
among the snows of Siberia, and the
north of Russia. There too is the sable,
whose fur is so dear, that I think you
once told me, a robe lined with it, is often
valued at a thousand pounds. We also
import furs from America, and I believe
frequently make use of that belonging to
the pretty innocent rabbit, and the graceful
cat, to line our muffs and shoes."</p>

<p>"They suffer alike with the faithful
dog, my dear," said her father, "as well
as other animals who are killed for our
use. In the northern regions the natives
could not stir from their homes, unless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
they were shielded from the severity of
the weather, by lining their clothes with
fur. Even in England, the gentlemen
feel the comforts of fur on their great
coats, and the ladies enjoy the benefit
of their muffs and tippets, although our
winter is not to be compared with that
of other countries."</p>

fellow had the impudence to tell me, as
I was getting out of my carriage, that I
had better wear my petticoat a little
longer to hide my legs, and put a shawl
on to conceal my neck. The fool had
no more taste than a Hottentot. Well,

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>"I have no objection to your selecting

"He was so good as to choose for me

<p>"Of linen rags, papa, but I do not
know how it is made."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>"No, my love, neither can I explain
it to you now, as the process is too long.
Theodore, can you inform me of the
origin of printing."</p>

<p>"Coining, and taking impressions in
wax, are of great antiquity," said Theodore,
"and the principle is precisely
the same as that of printing. The application
of this principle to the multiplication
of books, constituted the discovery
of the art of printing. The Chinese
have for many ages printed with
blocks, or whole pages engraved on
wood; but the application of single
letters or moveable types, forms the
merit and the superiority of the European
art. The honour of giving rise to
this method, has been claimed by the
cities of Harlem, Mentz, and Strasburg;
and to each of these it may be ascribed
in some degree, as printers resident in
each, made improvements in the art."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>"So far you are right, my dear boy,"
said his father, "it is recorded, that one
Laurentius, of Harlem, was the first inventor
of the leaden letters, which he
afterwards changed for a mixture of tin
and lead, as a more solid and durable
substance. We may suppose this to have
been about 1430. From this period,
printing made a rapid progress in most
of the chief towns of Europe. In 1490
it reached Constantinople, and was extended
by the middle of the following
century, to Africa and America. It was
for a long time believed that printing
was introduced into England, by one
William Caxton, a mercer, and citizen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
of London, who having resided many
years in Holland, Flanders, and Germany,
had made himself master of the
whole art, and set up a press in Westminster,
in 1471. But a book has since
been found, with a date of its impression
at Oxford, in 1468, and is considered as
a proof that printing began in that University
before Caxton practised it in
London. Emily, what have you got
there bound so handsomely in morocco?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Chapone's Letters, papa, it is
a present from mamma. And Maria has
got European Scenes, for Tarry at
Home Travellers, a very pretty book,
full of engravings. And Caroline has
chosen Keeper's Travels in Search of
his Master."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>"Very well, my dear, and here is
Sandford and Merton for our Theodore,

now made use of in libraries, because
it preserves the books from the moth,
the smell, perhaps, is not so agreeable.
Other books are bound in calves' skin,
which is a very pretty binding, and

<p class="cb"><i>Watch Maker</i></p>
</div>

<p>"The invention of clocks," said Mr.
Durnford, "is to be ascribed to the
Saracens, to whom we are indebted for
most of our mathematical sciences.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Hubert, Prince of Carrara, caused the
first clock that ever was <i>publicly</i> erected
to be put up at Padua, as they had
hitherto been shut up in Monasteries.
Towards the end of the fifteenth century,
clocks began to be in use among private
persons. Watches were used in London,
in the reign of Henry the Eighth.
Dante, the celebrated Italian poet, was
the first Author who mentions a clock
that struck the hour. But the use of
clocks was not confined to Italy at this
period; for we had an artist in England,
who furnished the famous clock house,
near Westminster Hall, with a clock to
be heard by the courts of law, in 1288.
Before this invention was generally
known, sun dials and hour glasses were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
used. The Elector of Saxony had a
clock set in the pummel of his saddle, and
the Emperor Charles the Fifth, had a
watch set as a jewel, in a ring. Nothing
can equal the perfection to which this
species of mechanism is now carried. I
have half a mind, Theodore, to treat you
to a watch, for you have deserved one
by your attention to your studies, and
our poor watch-maker looks so woe begone,
that I fear he has not sold one to-day.
Examine this plain gold hunting
watch, and tell me if you like it."</p>

<p>Theodore was in raptures with it, as
he had long sighed to possess a watch.
"Tell me in what country the gold which
composes the case of this watch is to be
found," said his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>"The Mines of Chili and Peru, in
America, are the richest, papa," replied
Theodore, "but very fine gold is found
in some parts of the East Indies. Gold
dust is found on the coast of Guinea, in
Africa, and hence the name of our largest
gold coin. Silver Mines are in all parts
of the world, but those of Potosi in Peru,
and some others in America, are the most
productive. All the precious stones,
which so frequently enrich the backs and
fronts of our watches, come also from
America, and Cornelian stones, of which
seals are made."</p>

<p>Mr. Durnford, highly delighted with
his son, now made him a present of a
gold watch and seals, one of which he
ordered to be engraved with his name.

<p>where the children were desired to take

<p>"All our fruits originally came from
abroad," said Mr. Durnford, "but we
have improved upon them, although our
climate is not sufficiently warm to bring
them to that perfection, which is the
boast of the Southern nations. The pineapple,
which you know is a most delicious
fruit, comes from the West Indies, but
we have excellent pineries in England, as
well as fine melons. They also are natives
of both the Indies. Our finest pears
are from France, oranges, nuts, almonds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
olives, grapes, chestnuts, pomegranates,
lemons, and prunes, all come from the
South of Europe. Oranges originally

by the fruit merchants. Some of these
look very good, therefore we will buy
some. Caroline, open your basket, and

<p class="cb"><i>Sculptor</i></p>
</div>

<p>said Mrs. Durnford, "the imitative arts
of sculpture and painting, made an
early appearance in Greece. Statuary,
a more simple imitation than painting,
was soonest brought to perfection: the
statues of Jupiter by Phidias, and of Juno
by Polycletes, were executed long before
the art of light and shade was known.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
Another cause likewise concurred to advance
statuary before painting, namely,
the great demand for statues of the
gods. In all countries where the people
are barbarous and illiterate, the progress
of the arts is extremely slow. Fine arts
are also precarious; they are not relished
but by persons of taste, who are comparatively
very few; for which reason,
they will never flourish in any country,
unless patronized by the Sovereign, or
by men of power and opulence. Our
own cathedrals can boast some beautiful
specimens of this art, among which the
works of Bacon and of Flaxman stand
conspicuous. Look, Caroline, at this
figure, can you tell me who it is meant
to represent?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>Caroline thought it was Mercury,
"but what does he hold in his hand,
mamma?"</p>

<p>"A caduceus, or wand, my dear, round
which are entwined two serpents. Mercury
is the god of eloquence, of arts
and sciences, and the messenger of
Jupiter. When you are a little older,
you must learn the history of the Heathen
gods and goddesses, else you will
remain ignorant of many beautiful allusions
in poetry. They are introduced
likewise into painting, of which I shall be
happy, my Theodore, if you can give
me some account."</p>

<p>"It is said to have had its rise among
the Egyptians," said Theodore, "but the
Greeks, who learned it of them, carried
it to the summit of perfection, if we may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
believe the stories related of their Apelles
and Zeuxis. The Romans, in the latter
times of the Republic, and under the
first emperors, were not without considerable
masters in the art; but the inundation
of barbarians which deluged
Italy, proved fatal to the arts, and almost
reduced painting to its first elements. It
was in Italy, however, that painting returned
to its ancient honour, when
Cimaluce, born at Florence, transferred
the poor remains of the art from a Greek
painter into his own country."</p>

<p>"You are right, my dear boy," said
his father, "he was seconded in his attempts
by other Florentines. The first
who gained any reputation, were Ghirlaudias,
Michael Angelo's master; Pietro
Perugino, the master of Raphael Urbino;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
and Andrea Verocchio, the teacher of
Leonardo da Vinci. Michael Angelo
founded the School of Florence; Raphael
that of Rome, and Leonardo da Vinci,
the School of Milan; to which I may
add, the Lombard School under Georgione
and Titian. France also has given
birth to some eminent painters, as Poussin,
Lebrun, David, and others, and our own
country, during the last century, has
been distinguished by artists, such as
Reynolds, Hogarth, West, Barry, Wilson,
Morland, Gainsborough, and many
others. At the exhibition at Somerset
House, you will see a fine collection of
paintings, and models of Sculpture, besides
a variety of miniature pictures,
which are very beautiful. And now, my
dear children, I think we have seen all
the contents of the Bazaar, which I hope
has amused as well as instructed you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>The young people all expressed their
thanks to their kind parents for the entertainment
they had received, as well
from the curious characters which they
had seen drawn together by the same
motives, as from the inspection of the
various articles which the neat and elegant
little shops contained.</p>

<p>"I think we could not have spent a
morning better," said Mrs. Durnford,

we will now return home to dinner,
perfectly well satisfied with The Visit to

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
